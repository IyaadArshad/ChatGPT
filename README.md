# ChatGPT
Open-Sourcering ChatGPT

# Introduction
I've been getting bugged by these "You've hit your free limits" etc. etc. from OpenAI's ChatGPT, what about Deepseek? Or Perplexity? Or Copilot?

I'm a bit sick of the AI hype, but OpenAI is like the Coca-Cola of these AI companies, there are plenty of these companies, but OpenAI has got the signature brand name, and I guess I'd like to just stick with that.

So I searched up "ChatGPT" on GitHub looking for some ChatGPT clone that I could plug my API key into and continue working, let's keep it short, the results I found were not what I was looking for, and plenty of them were desktop apps of the ChatGPT sites

Therefore, this repository will be created to create an open source version of ChatGPT, there's alot of things that ChatGPT can do that the API cannot, so those gaps will have to be filled in (ChatGPT seems to know when to call images, searching up things, reasoning etc.)

I'm not sure how long this will take, but I'm sure it will be a fun project to work on, and I'm sure it will be a fun project to work on with others, so if you're interested in working on this project, feel free to fork this repository and start working on it, I'll be sure to check out your pull requests and issues

I'm having my CS mocks so my contributions to this project will be limited for the next week, but I'll be sure to check out your pull requests and issues

# Potential roadmap
We'll be using NextJS, I guess the roadmap will go something like this:
- Replicate ChatGPT UI
- Add some sort of account system (log in, log out etc.)
- Add Chat History With Date stamps
- Add functionality to chat (First text, then support other files)
- Integrate search and reasoning
